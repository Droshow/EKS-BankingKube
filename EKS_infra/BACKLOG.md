# BankingKube: Optimized EKS-Based Blogging Platform

## Overview

This guide outlines how to host a cost-effective blogging website using AWS EKS, leveraging automation and ephemeral resources to minimize costs. The goal is to maintain a scalable, flexible infrastructure while keeping expenses low, ideally under $10 per month.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Optimized EKS Usage
- **Minimal Uptime for EKS**: Only spin up the EKS cluster when updates are required. This approach minimizes the active time of EKS, significantly reducing costs.
- **Scheduled Updates**: Automate the process to schedule updates during low-cost periods (e.g., spot instance availability). Use IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to spin up the EKS cluster, deploy updates, and tear it down immediately afterward.

### 2. Static Content Hosting with S3 and CloudFront
- **Static Site Generation**: Use Ghost CMS in a container on EKS to generate static content. Once generated, push this content to an S3 bucket, which will serve as the primary hosting for your website.
- **CloudFront for Global Distribution**: Use CloudFront to distribute your content globally, taking advantage of the free tier and low-cost edge caching. This setup reduces the need for EKS uptime and leverages the cost-effectiveness of S3 and CloudFront for static content.

### 3. Containerized Ghost CMS with S3 Persistence
- **Run Ghost CMS Temporarily**: Deploy Ghost CMS in a Docker container within EKS only when needed for content creation or updates. Persist data in S3 so that the content is accessible and can be pushed to S3 as a static site after each update.
- **S3 Storage**: Use S3 for storing all media and content generated by Ghost CMS, minimizing costs since you only pay for what you store.

### 4. Ephemeral Resources and Automation
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automate the deployment and teardown of your EKS cluster, ALB, and any necessary infrastructure using Terraform or CloudFormation. This ensures that resources are only up and running when needed.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrate your IaC with a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) that triggers the deployment process only when changes are pushed to the repository. This way, the infrastructure spins up, deploys updates, and then tears down automatically.

### 5. Cost Management and Optimization
- **Use Spot Instances**: For the short periods that EKS is running, utilize spot instances to minimize costs. Spot instances can be 70-90% cheaper than on-demand instances.
- **Monitor Usage**: Implement monitoring with AWS CloudWatch and cost management tools to track spending and optimize usage. Set up alerts to notify you if costs start to exceed your budget.

### 6. DNS and Routing
- **Route 53 for DNS**: Use Route 53 for DNS management. This service is cost-effective, and by keeping your website static (via S3 and CloudFront), DNS queries remain minimal and inexpensive.
- **Ephemeral ALB Usage**: Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) only during the update process. For the rest of the time, the ALB can be shut down, minimizing costs.

### 7. Security and Maintenance
- **Automated Backups**: Set up automated backups of your S3 content and any databases used by Ghost CMS (if not fully static). This ensures data is secure without requiring constant EKS uptime.
- **Security Best Practices**: Implement best practices such as VPC isolation, security groups, IAM roles, and S3 bucket policies to secure your resources while minimizing the attack surface.

## Example Monthly Cost Breakdown (Estimates)
- **EKS (Minimal Usage)**: $0.10/hour, assuming 10 hours per month = $1.00
- **t3.micro Spot Instances**: ~$0.01/hour, assuming 10 hours per month = $0.10
- **S3 Storage**: Minimal costs, likely less than $1.00 depending on usage.
- **CloudFront (Low Traffic)**: Could fall within the AWS free tier or cost minimal = ~$1.00
- **Route 53 DNS**: $0.50/month for a single hosted zone.
- **ALB (Ephemeral Use)**: Assuming limited usage during updates, could be minimal = $1.00

### Total Estimate: **$4.60 to $10.00 per month**, depending on usage patterns and optimizations.

## Conclusion

By automating the deployment and teardown of your EKS cluster and using AWS services like S3 and CloudFront for content delivery, you can manage a cost-effective and scalable blogging platform that balances the flexibility of Kubernetes with practical cost constraints. This setup is achievable for a DevOps engineer, allowing you to focus on automation and optimization while keeping operational costs low.
