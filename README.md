## To-Do
- [ ] **Ingress**: Set up an Ingress controller, such as NGINX or ALB Ingress Controller, to expose services to the outside world.
- [ ] **Storage**: Set up storage solutions, such as EBS volumes or EFS file systems, for applications that need to persist data or share data between pods.
- [ ] **Logging & Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring for observability. This could involve setting up CloudWatch logs for the cluster and integrating with a monitoring solution like Prometheus and Grafana.
- [ ] **Autoscaling**: Set up the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler and the Kubernetes Metrics Server to automatically scale the cluster based on load.
