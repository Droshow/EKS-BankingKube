# BankingKube API Development Guide - App Development

## Overview
This guide outlines the steps for developing the BankingKube API, which facilitates open banking transactions. The API will support operations such as initiating payments, retrieving transaction status, and managing user consent.

## Step 1: Define API Specifications

### Objective
Establish the functional requirements and endpoints of your API.

### Tasks
- **Identify Key Operations**: Determine necessary operations like initiating payments, retrieving transaction status, and managing user consent.
- **Design RESTful Endpoints**:
  - `POST /payments` - Initiate a payment.
  - `GET /payments/{id}` - Check payment status.
  - `POST /consents` - Manage user consents.

## Step 2: Set Up the Golang Environment

### Objective
Prepare your development environment for Golang.

### Tasks
- **Install Go**: Ensure the latest version of Go is installed on your development machine.
- **Choose an IDE**: Select an IDE or editor that supports Go, such as Visual Studio Code or GoLand.
- **Set Up Version Control**: Initialize a Git repository to manage version control.

## Step 3: Create a Basic HTTP Server

### Objective
Build a foundational HTTP server in Golang to serve as the backbone for your API.

### Tasks
- **Use `net/http` Package**: Start by creating a simple server using Golang's built-in `net/http` package.
- **Routing**: Implement basic routing to handle requests to your defined endpoints.

## Step 4: Integrate with Open Banking APIs

### Objective
Develop functionality to communicate with bank APIs.

### Tasks
- **Authentication**: Implement the authentication mechanism required by the bankâ€™s API (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
- **API Calls**: Use `net/http` or `github.com/go-resty/resty/v2` for making HTTP calls to the bank APIs.
- **Error Handling**: Handle API responses robustly, focusing on error responses from the bank APIs.

## Step 5: Implement Logging and Error Handling

### Objective
Ensure robust logging and error handling for troubleshooting and compliance.

### Tasks
- **Logging**: Use a logging package such as `logrus` or `zap` for structured logging.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling across your API.

## Step 6: Testing

### Objective
Write tests to ensure your API functions as expected.

### Tasks
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for individual functions, particularly those interfacing with bank APIs.
- **Integration Tests**: Develop integration tests that run against a test version of the bank APIs (if available).

## Conclusion
Begin with setting up a simple server and gradually integrate more complex functionalities like communicating with bank APIs, handling authentication, and robust error handling. Maintain a focus on writing clean, maintainable code and establishing a solid foundation with good testing practices from the start.
