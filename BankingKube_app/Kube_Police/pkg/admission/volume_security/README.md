## volume_security/

### Purpose:
Manages the use of persistent volumes and storage configurations to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive host paths and secure storage configurations.

### Key Benefits:
- Prevents the use of disallowed host paths like /var/run/docker.sock.
- Enforces secure storage class policies.
- Restricts the use of insecure volume types (e.g., emptyDir).

### Checks Implemented:
- Validates volume configurations against defined security policies.
- Ensures sensitive paths and storage classes are not used improperly.
